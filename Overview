Classifying the stages of alzheimers disease from brain MRI scans

Namely:
1.Cognitively Normal(CN)
The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to aging or stress. Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex activities of daily living. The most noticeable deficit is short term memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.

2. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)     
Mild Cognitive Normal (MCI) is a moderate or the middle stage of Alzheimer's disease. In this   stage functionality of the brain get worse. The signs of disease become more pronounced and the person starts getting problem in performing some tasks and starts forgetting details about their past. The duration can be large it generally varies between 2 years to 10 years.  

 3: Alzheimer's Disease (AD)          
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the last stage of Alzheimer's disease. In this stage the nerve cells in the brain gets extensively damaged. In this stage the patient forgets to talk, walk death also occurs when the body stops fighting with the infection. The patient in this stage needs more care. And there is no cure if the patient is in the last stage, generally in the last stage patient survives between 1 year to 3 years.



We will analyse two approaches in for this classification problem.
1.Basic Supervised Learning approach.
2.CNN based transfer learning approach.


The dataset used in the this work was collected from Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging  Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

Data of 80 patients in each category of the disease has been choosen which means we have taken 80 subjects of AD, 80 subjects of CN, and 80 subjects of MCI total 240 images.
